Purpose:
Learning the basics of android programming through the creation of a simple interactive application.

What It Does:
Every button pressed fundamentally works the same way. A song plays in the background while the user controls the shape
displayed by tilting the phone around. 

How it Works:
The first thing the user encounters is a splash page, which is mostly used for trademark purposes and serves as an 
introduction to what is to come.
 
After the splash page, a menu is shown with three options:
 
1.)Start Button
2.)Instructions
3.)End
 
If Start button is pressed:
- Takes the user to a page in which there are four button options and one end button
- Each button option contains different shapes and songs
 
If Instructions is pressed:
- Takes user to a page of text that provides intructions on how to use the app
 
If End is pressed:
- Exits the application
